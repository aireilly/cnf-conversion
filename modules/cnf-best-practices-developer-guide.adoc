== Goal

This document is mainly for the developers of workloads, who need to build high-performance applications in a containerized environment. We have created a guide that any partner can take and follow when developing their workloads so that they can be deployed on the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) in a secure, efficient and supportable way.
