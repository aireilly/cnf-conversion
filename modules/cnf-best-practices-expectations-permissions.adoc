[id="cnf-best-practices-far-edge-restrictions"]
== CNF restrictions

* CNFs may not use host networking

* Namespace should not be created by the CNFs deployment method (Helm / Operator)

* CNFs may not perform Role creation

* CNFs may not perform Rolebinding creation

* CNFs may not have Cluster Roles

* CNFs are not authorized to bring their own CNI

* CNFs may not deploy Daemonsets


[id="cnf-best-practices-pod-permissions"]
=== Pod permissions

By default, pods should not expect to be permitted to run as root. Pod restrictions are enforced by SCC within the OpenShift platform. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html[Managing security context constraints].

Pods will execute on worker nodes, by default being admitted to the cluster with the "restricted" SCC.

The "restricted" SCC:

* Ensures that no containers within the pod can run with the `allowPrivilegedContainer` flag set.

* Ensures that pods cannot mount host directory volumes. 

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-pod-host-path[access-control-pod-host-path]

* Requires that a pod run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs from the namespace annotation.

* Requires that a pod run with a pre-allocated MCS label from the namespace annotation.

* Allows pods to use any supplemental group.

Any pods requiring elevated privileges must document the required capabilities driven by application syscalls and a process to validate the requirements must occur.

[id="cnf-best-practices-logging"]
=== Logging

Log aggregation and analysis::
--
* Containers are expected to write logs to stdout. It is highly recommended that stdout/stderr leverage some standard logging format for output.
+
* Logs CAN be parsed to a limited extent so that specific vendor logs can be sent back to the CNF if required.
+
* CNFs requiring log parsing must leverage some standard logging library or format for all stdout/stderr. Examples of standard logging libraries include; `klog`, `rfc5424`, and `oslo`.

[id="cnf-best-practices-monitoring"]
=== Monitoring

Network Functions are expected to bring their own metrics collection functions (e.g. Prometheus) for their application specific metrics. This metrics collector will not be expected to nor able to poll platform level metric data.

[id="cnf-best-practices-cpu-allocation"]
=== CPU allocation

It is important to note that when the OpenShift scheduler is placing pods, it first reviews the Pod CPU request and schedules it if there is a node that meets the requirements. It will then impose the CPU "Limits" to ensure the Pod doesn't consume more than the intended allocation. The limit can never be lower than the request.

NUMA Configuration:: OpenShift provides a topology manager which leverages the CPU manager and Device manager to help associate processes to CPUs. Topology manager handles NUMA affinity. This feature is available as of OpenShift 4.6. For some examples on how to leverage the topology manager and creating workloads that work in real time, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.html[Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html[Low latency tuning].

[id="cnf-best-practices-memory-allocation"]
=== Memory allocation

Regarding memory allocation, there are a couple of considerations. How much of the platform is OpenShift itself using, and how much is left over to allocate for the applications running on OpenShift?

Once it has been determined how much memory is left over for the applications, quotas can be applied which specify both the requested amount of memory and limits. In the case of where a memory request has been specified, OpenShift will not schedule the pod unless the amount of memory required to launch it is available. In the case of a limit being specified, OpenShift will not allocate more memory to the application than the limit provides.

[NOTE]
====
When the OpenShift scheduler is placing pods, it reviews the pod memory request and schedules the pod if there is a node that meets the requirements. It then imposes memory limits to ensure the pod doesn't consume more than the intended allocation. The limit can never be lower than the request.

[id="cnf-best-practices-pod-interaction/configuration"]
==== Pod interaction and configuration

Pod configurations should be created in a kubernetes native manner, the most basic example of a kubernetes native manner of configuration deployment is the use of a `ConfigMap` CR. `ConfigMap` CRs can be loaded into Kubernetes and pods can consume the data in a configmap by using the data in the `ConfigMap` to populate container environment variables or can be consumed as volumes in a container and read by an application.

Interaction with a running pod should be done via `oc exec` or `oc rsh` commands. This allows API role-based access control (RBAC) to the pods and command line interaction for debugging.

.CNF requirement
[IMPORTANT]
====
SSH daemons must NOT be used in Openshift for pod interaction.

====

[id="cnf-best-practices-pod-exit-status"]
==== Pod exit status

The most basic requirement for the lifecycle management of pods in OpenShift is the ability to start and stop correctly. When starting up, health probes like liveness and readiness checks can be put into place to ensure the application is functioning properly.

There are different ways a pod can be stopped in Kubernetes. One way is that the pod can remain alive but non-functional. Another way is that the pod can crash and become non-functional. In the first case, if the administrator has implemented liveness and readiness checks, OpenShift can stop the pod and either restart it on the same node or a different node in the cluster. For the second case, when the application in the pod stops, it should exit with a code and write suitable log entries to help the administrator diagnose what the issue was that caused the problem.

Pods should use `terminationMessagePolicy: FallbackToLogsOnError` to summarize why they crashed and use stderr to report errors on crash

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#observability-termination-policy[observability-termination-policy]

.CNF requirement
[IMPORTANT]

====

[id="cnf-best-practices-graceful-termination"]
==== Graceful termination

There are different reasons that a pod may need to shutdown on an OpenShift cluster. It might be that the node the pod is running on needs to be shut down for maintenance, or the administrator is doing a rolling update of an application to a new version which requires that the old versions are shutdown properly.

When pods are shut down by the platform they are sent a `SIGTERM` signal which means that the process in the container should start shutting down, closing connections and stopping all activity. If the pod doesn't shut down within the default 30 seconds then the platform may send a `SIGKILL` signal which will stop the pod immediately. This method isn't as clean and the default time between the `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL` messages can be modified based on the requirements of the application.

Pods should exit with zero exit codes when they are gracefully terminated.

.CNF requirement
[IMPORTANT]
====
All pods must respond to SIGTERM signal and shutdown gracefully with a zero exit code.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#lifecycle-container-shutdown[lifecycle-container-shutdown]
====

[id="cnf-best-practices-pod-resource-profiles"]
==== Pod resource profiles

OpenShift has a default scheduler that is responsible for the currently available resources on the platform, placing containers or applications on the platform appropriately. In order for OpenShift to do this correctly, the application developer must create a resource profile for the application. This resource profile contains requirements such as how much memory, CPU, and storage that the application needs. At this point, the scheduler is aware of what nodes in the cluster can satisfy the workload. It places the application on one of those nodes. The scheduler can also place the application pod in a pending state until resources are available.

All pods should have a resource request that is the minimum amount of resources the pod is expected to use at steady state for both memory and CPU.

[id="cnf-best-practices-storage:-emptydir"]
==== Storage: emptyDir

There are several options for volumes and reading and writing files in OpenShift. When the requirement is temporary storage and given the option to write files into directories in containers versus an external filesystems, choose the `emptyDir` option. This will provide the administrator with the same temporary filesystem - when the pod is stopped the dir is deleted forever. Also, the `emptyDir` can be backed by whatever medium is backing the node, or it can be set to memory for faster reads and writes.

Using `emptyDir` with requested local storage limits instead of writing to the container directories also allows enabling `readonlyRootFilesystem` on the container or pod.

[id="cnf-best-practices-liveness-readiness-and-startup-probes"]
==== Liveness readiness and startup probes

As part of the pod lifecycle, the OpenShift platform needs to know what state the pod is in at all times. This can be accomplished with different health checks. There are at least three states that are important to the platform: startup, running, shutdown. Applications can also be running, but not healthy, meaning, the pod is up and the application shows no errors, but it cannot serve any requests.

When an application starts up on OpenShift it may take a while for the application to become ready to accept connections from clients, or perform whatever duty it is intended for.

Two health checks that are required to monitor the status of the applications are liveness and readiness. As mentioned above, the application can be running but not actually able to serve requests. This can be detected with liveness checks. The liveness check will send specific requests to the application that, if satisfied, indicate that the pod is in a healthy state and operating within the required parameters that the administrator has set. A failed liveness check will result in the container being restarted.

There is also a consideration of pod startup. Here the pod may start and take a while for different reasons. Pods can be marked as ready if they pass the readiness check. The readiness check determines that the pod has started properly and is able to answer requests. There are circumstances where both checks are used to monitor the applications in the pods. A failed readiness check results in the container being taken out of the available service endpoints. An example of this being relevant is when the pod was under heavy load, failed the readiness check, gets taken out of the endpoint pool, processes requests, passes the readiness check and is added back to the endpoint pool.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/[Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the CNF is doing CPU pinning and running a DPDK process do not use exec probes (executing a command within the container); as this can pile up and eventually block the node.

[id="cnf-best-practices-affinity/anti-affinity"]
==== Affinity and anti-affinity

In OpenShift Container Platform pod affinity and pod anti-affinity allow you to constrain which nodes your pod are eligible to be scheduled based on the key/value labels on other pods. There are two types of affinity rules, required and preferred. Required rules must be met, whereas preferred rules are best effort.

These pod affinity/anti-affinity rules are set in the pod specification as `matchExpressions` to a `labelSelector`. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-affinity.html[Placing pods relative to other pods using affinity and anti-affinity rules] for more information. The following example `Pod` CR illustrates pod affinity:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-pod-affinity
spec:

==== Upgrade expectations

* The Kubernetes API deprecation policy defined in link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/[Kubernetes Deprecation Policy] shall be followed.

* CNFs are expected to maintain service continuity during platform upgrades, and during CNF version upgrades

* CNFs need to be prepared for nodes to reboot or shut down without notice

* CNFs shall configure pod disruption budget appropriately to maintain service continuity during platform upgrades

* Applications should not be tied to a specific version of Kubernetes or any of its components

[IMPORTANT]
====
Applications MUST specify a pod disruption budget appropriately to maintain service continuity during platform upgrades. The budget should be defined with a balance such that it allows operational flexibility for the cluster to drain nodes, but restrictive enough so that the service is not degraded over upgrades.

[id="cnf-best-practices-taints-and-tolerations"]
==== Taints and tolerations

Taints and tolerations allow the node to control which pods are scheduled on the node. A taint allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching toleration.

You apply taints to a node through the node specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the pod specification (`PodSpec`). A taint on a node instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

Taints and tolerations consist of a key, value, and effect. An operator allows you to leave one of these parameters empty.

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations.html[Controlling pod placement using node taints] for more information.

[id="cnf-best-practices-requests/limits"]
==== Requests/Limits

Requests and limits provide a way for a CNF developer to ensure they have adequate resources available to run the application. Requests can be made for storage, memory, CPU and so on. These requests and limits can be enforced by quotas. Quotas can be used as a way to enforce requests and limits. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/quotas/quotas-setting-per-project.html[Resource quotas per project] for more information.

Nodes can be overcommitted which can affect the strategy of request/limit implementation. For example, when you need guaranteed capacity, use quotas to enforce. In a development environment, you can overcommit where a trade-off of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable. Overcommitment can be done on a project, node or cluster level.

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-overcommit.html[Configuring your cluster to place pods on overcommitted nodes] for more information.

====

[id="cnf-best-practices-use-imagepullpolicy-if-not-present"]
==== Use imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

If there is a situation where the container dies and needs to be restarted, the image pull policy becomes important. There are three image pull policies available: `Always`, `Never` and `IfNotPresent`. It is generally recommended to have a pull policy of `IfNotPresent`. This means that the if pod needs to restart for any reason, the kubelet will check on the node where the pod is starting and reuse the already downloaded container image if it's available. OpenShift intentionally does not set `AlwaysPullImages` as turning on this admission plugin can introduce new kinds of cluster failure modes. Self-hosted infrastructure components are still pods: enabling this feature can result in cases where a loss of contact to an image registry can cause redeployment of an infrastructure or application pod to fail. We use `PullIfNotPresent` so that a loss of image registry access does not prevent the pod from restarting.

[NOTE]
====
Container images that are protected by registry authentication have a condition whereby a user who is unable to download an image directly can still launch it by leveraging the host's cached image.

[id="cnf-best-practices-automount-services-for-pods"]
==== Automount services for pods

Pods which do not require API access should set the value of `automountServiceAccountToken` to false within the pod spec, for example:

[id="cnf-best-practices-disruption-budgets"]
==== Disruption budgets

When managing the platform there are at least two types of disruptions that can occur. They are voluntary and involuntary. When dealing with voluntary disruptions a pod disruption budget can be set that determines how many replicas of the application must remain running at any given time. For example, consider the case where an administrator is shutting down a node for

maintenance and the node has to be drained. If there is a pod disruption budget set then OpenShift will respect that and ensure that the required number of pods are available by bringing up pods on different nodes before draining the current node.

==== Image tagging

An image tag is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image from other images. Image tags may be used to categorize images (for example: latest, stable, development) and by versions within the categories. This allows the administrator to be specific when declaring which image to test, or which image to run in production.

[id="cnf-best-practices-one-process-per-container"]
==== One process per container

OpenShift organizes workloads into pods. Pods are the smallest unit of a workload that Kubernetes understands. Within pods, one can have one or more containers. Containers are essentially composed of the runtime that is required to launch and run a process.

Each container should run only one process. Different processes should always be split between containers, and where possible also separate into different pods. This can help in a number of ways, such as troubleshooting, upgrades and more efficient scaling.

However, OpenShift does support running multiple containers per pod. This can be useful if parts of the application need to share namespaces like networking and storage resources. Additionally, there are other models like launching init containers, sidecar containers, etc. which may justify running multiple containers in a single pod.

More information about pods can be found link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-using.html[Using pods].

[id="cnf-best-practices-security-rbac"]
=== Security and role-based access control

Roles / RoleBindings:: A `Role` represents a set of permissions within a particular namespace. E.g: A given user can list pods/services within the namespace. The `RoleBinding` is used for granting the permissions defined in a role to a user or group of users. Applications may create roles and rolebindings within their namespace, however the scope of a role will be limited to the same permissions that the creator has or less.

See test case link:https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/CATALOG.md#access-control-pod-role-bindings[access-control-pod-role-bindings]

ClusterRole / ClusterRoleBinding:: A `ClusterRole` represents a set of permissions at the cluster level that can be used by multiple namespaces. The `ClusterRoleBinding` is used for granting the permissions defined in a `ClusterRole` to a user or group of users at a namespace level. Applications are not permitted to install cluster roles or create cluster role bindings. This is an administrative activity done by cluster administrators. CNFs should not use cluster roles; exceptions can be granted to allow this, however this is discouraged.

[id="cnf-best-practices-multus"]
=== MULTUS

MULTUS is a meta-CNI that allows multiple CNIs that it delegates to. This allows pods to get additional interfaces beyond `eth0` via additional CNIs. Having additional CNIs for SR-IOV and MacVLAN interfaces allow for direct routing of traffic to a pod without using the pod network via additional interfaces. This capability is being delivered for use in only corner case scenarios, it is not to be used in general for all applications. Example use cases include bandwidth requirements that necessitate SR-IOV and protocols that are unable to be supported by the load balancer. The OVN based pod network should be used for every interface that can be supported from a technical standpoint.

.CNF requirement
[IMPORTANT]

SR-IOV is a specification that allows a PCIe device to appear to be multiple separate physical PCIe devices. The Performance Addon component allows you to validate SR-IOV by running DPDK, SCTP and device checking tests.

SR-IOV and MACVLAN interfaces are able to be requested for protocols that do not work with the default CNI or for exceptions where a network function has not been able to move functionality onto the CNI. These are exception use cases. MULTUS interfaces will be defined by the platform operations team for the network functions which can then consume them. VLANs will be applied by the SR-IOV VF, thus the VLAN / network that the SR-IOV interface requires must be part of the request for the namespace.

For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.html[About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks].

By configuring the SR-IOV network, CRs named `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions` are exposed by the SR-IOV Operator in the CNF namespace.

Different names will be assigned to different Network Attachment Definitions that are namespace specific. MACVLAN versus MULTUS interfaces will be named differently to distinguish the type of device assigned to them (created by configuring SR-IOV devices via the SRIOVNetworkNodePolicy CR).

From the CNF perspective, a defined set of network attachment definitions will be available in the assigned namespace to serve secondary networks for regular usage or to serve for DPDK payloads.

The SR-IOV devices are configured by the cluster admin, and they will be available in the namespace assigned to the CNF. The following command returns the list of secondary networks available in the namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <cnf_namespace> get network-attachment-definitions

[id="cnf-best-practices-sr-iov-interface-settings"]
=== SR-IOV interface settings

The following settings must be negotiated with the cluster administrator, for each network type available in the namespace:

* The type of netdevice to be used for the VF (kernel or userspace)

* The vlan ID to be applied to a given set of VFs available in a namespace

* For kernel-space devices, the IP allocation is provided directly by the cluster IP assignment mechanism.

* The option to configure the IP of a given SR-IOV interface at runtime, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/hardware_networks/add-pod.html[Adding a pod to an SR-IOV additional network].

[NOTE]
====
SR-IOV settings are enabled by the cluster administrator.

[NOTE]
====
the IP information is not available if the driver specified is `vf-io`.
====

The same annotation is available as a file content inside the pod, at the `/etc/podnetinfo/annotations` path. A convenience library is available to easily consume those informations from the application (bindings in C and Go).

[id="cnf-best-practices-numa-awareness"]
=== NUMA awareness

If the pod is using a guaranteed QoS class and the kubelet is configured with a suitable topology manager policy (restricted, single-numa node) then the VF assigned to the pod will belong to the same NUMA node as the other assigned resources (CPU and other NUMA aware devices). Please note that HugePages are currently not NUMA aware.

See <<cnf-best-practices-performance-addon-operator-pao>> for NUMA awareness and more information about how HugePages are turned on.

[id="cnf-best-practices-platform-upgrade"]
=== Platform upgrade

Openshift upgrades happen as follows:

Consider this small example cluster:

[source,terminal]
----
master-0
master-1
master-2
worker-10
worker-11
worker-12
worker-13
loadbalancer-14
loadbalancer-15
----

In the above example cluster, there are three machine config pools: masters, workers, loadbalancers. This is an example cluster configuration, there may be more machine config pools based on functionality, e.g., 10 MCPs if needed.

When the cluster is upgraded, the API server and etcD are updated first. So the master config pool will be done first. Incrementally the cluster will go through and reboot master-0, 1, 2 to bring them to the new kubernetes version. After these are updated it will cycle to the next two machine pools one at a time. Openshift will consult the maxunavilable nodes in the machine config pool spec and reboot only as many as allowed by maxunavailable.

In a cluster as small as the above, `maxUnavailable` would be set to 1, so OpenShift would reboot loadbalancer-14 and worker-10 simultaneously as they are different machineconfigpools.

Openshift will wait until worker-10 is ready before proceeding onwards to worker-11 and continue. OpenShift will in parallel wait for loadbalancer-14 to become available again before restarting loadbalancer-15.

In clusters larger than the example cluster, the `maxUnavailable` for the worker pool may be set to a large number to reboot multiple nodes in parallel to speed up deployment of the new version of OpenShift. This number will take into account the work loads on the cluster to make sure sufficient resources are left to maintain application availability.

For an application to stay healthy during this process, if they are stateful at all, they should specify a statefulset or replicaset, kubernetes by default will attempt to schedule the set members across multiple nodes to give additional resiliency. In order to prevent kubernetes from stealing too many nodes out from under an application, an application that has a minimum number of pods that need to be running must specify a pod disruption budget. Pod disruption budgets allow an application to tell kubernetes that it needs N number of pods of said microservice alive at any given time. For example, a small stateful database may need 2 out of three pods available at any given time, so that application should set a pod disruption budget with a minavailable set to a value of 2. This will allow the scheduler to know that it should not take the second pod out of a set of 3 down at any given time during the series of node reboots.

[NOTE]
====
Do NOT set your pod disruption budget to `maxUnavailable` <number of pods in replica> or minUnavailable zero, operations will change your pod disruption budget to proceed with an upgrade at the risk of your application.
====

A corollary to the pod disruption budget is a strong readiness and health check. A well implemented readiness check is key for surviving these upgrades in that a pod should not report itself ready to kubernetes until it is actually ready to take over the load from another pod of the example set. An example of this being implemented poorly would be for a pod to report itself ready but it is not in sync with the other DB pods in the example above. Kubernetes could see that three of the pods are "ready" and destroy a second pod and cause disruption to the DB leading to failure of the application served by said DB.

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/[pod disruption budget reference].

    matchLabels:
      app: db
----

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/recommended-host-practices.html[Recommended performance and scalability practices].

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

Run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

Set `maxUnavailable` to the desired value.

=== OpenShift virtualization and CNV best practices

OpenShift Virtualization is generally-available for enterprise workloads, such throughput- and latency-insensitive workloads that may be added to the cluster. VNFs and other throughput or latency-sensitive applications can be considered only after careful validation.

OpenShift Virtualization should be installed according to its documentation, and only documented supported features may be used unless an explicit exception has been granted. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/virt/about-virt.html[About OpenShift Virtualization].

In order to improve overall virtualization performance and reduce CPU latency, critical VNFs can take advantage of OpenShift Virtualization's high-performance features. These can provide the VNFs with the following features:

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-dedicated-resources-vm.html[Dedicated resources for virtual machines]

* link:https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/dedicated_cpu_resources/#requesting-dedicated-cpu-for-qemu-emulator[Dedicated CPU for QEMU emulators]

* link:https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/disks_and_volumes/#iothreads-with-qemu-emulator-thread-and-dedicated-pinned-cpus[A separate physical CPU] so as to not affect the CPU latency for workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Similar to OpenStack, OpenShift Virtualization supports the link:https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/startup_scripts/#device-role-tagging[device role tagging mechanism] for the network interfaces (same format as it is in OSP). Users will be able to tag Network interfaces in the API and identify them in device metadata provided to the guest OS via the config drive.
====

[id="cnf-best-practices-vm-image-import-recommendations-cdi"]
==== VM image import recommendations (CDI)

OpenShift Virtualization VMs store their persistent disks on kubernetes Persistent Volumes (`PV`). PVs are requested by VMs using kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (`PVC`). VMs may require a combination of blank and pre-populated disks in order to function.

Blank disks can be initialized automatically by kubevirt when an empty PV is initially encountered by a starting VM. Other disks must be populated prior to starting the VM. OpenShift Virtualization provides a component called the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) which automates the preparation of pre-populated persistent disks for VMs. CDI integrates with KubeVirt to synchronize VM creation and deletion with disk preparation by using a custom resource called a DataVolume. Using DataVolumes, data can be imported into a PV from various sources including container registries and HTTP servers.

The following recommendations should be followed when managing persistent disks for VMs:

Blank disks:: Create a PVC and associate it with the VM using a persistentVolumeClaim volume type in the volumes section of the VirtualMachine spec.

Populated disks:: In the VirtualMachine spec, add a DataVolume to the dataVolumeTemplates section and always use the dataVolume volume type in the volumes section.

[id="cnf-best-practices-working-with-large-vm-disk-images"]
==== Working with large VM disk images

In contrast to container images, VM disk images can be quite large (30GiB or more is common). It is important to consider the costs of transferring large amounts of data when planning workflows involving the creation of VMs (especially when scaling up the number of VMs). The efficiency of an image import depends on the format of the file and also the transfer method used. The most efficient workflow, for two reasons, is to host a gzip-compressed raw image on a server and import via HTTP. Compression avoids transferring zeros present in the free space of the image, and CDI can stream the contents directly into the target PV without any intermediate conversion steps. In contrast, images imported from a container registry must be transferred, unarchived, and converted prior to being usable. These additional steps increase the amount of data transferred between a node and the remote storage.

[id="cnf-best-practices-operator-best-practices"]
=== Operator best practices

OLM Packaged operators contain an index of all the images required to install the operator, and the `ClusterServiceVersion` which instructs OpenShift to create resources as described in the cluster service version. The cluster service version is a list of the required resources that need to be created in the cluster, i.e. service accounts, crds, roles, etc that are necessary for the operator and software that the operator installs to be successful within the cluster.

The OLM Packaged operator will then run in openshift-operators namespace within the cluster. Users can then utilize this operator by creating CRs within the CRDs that were created by the operator OLM package, to deploy the software managed by the operator. The platform administrator handles the OLM based operator installation for the users by creating a custom catalog in the cluster that is targeted by the application. The users then express via CRs that are consumed by the operator what they would like the operator to create in the users namespace.
