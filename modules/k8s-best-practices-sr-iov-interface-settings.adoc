= SR-IOV interface settings

The following settings must be negotiated with the cluster administrator, for each network type available in the namespace:

* The type of netdevice to be used for the VF (kernel or userspace)

* The vlan ID to be applied to a given set of VFs available in a namespace

* For kernel-space devices, the IP allocation is provided directly by the cluster IP assignment mechanism.

* The option to configure the IP of a given SR-IOV interface at runtime, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/hardware_networks/add-pod.html[Adding a pod to an SR-IOV additional network].

[NOTE]
====
SR-IOV settings are enabled by the cluster administrator.
====

The `SRIOVnetwork` CR creates the `network-attach-definition` within the target `networkNamespace`.
