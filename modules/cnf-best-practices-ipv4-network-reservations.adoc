= IPv4 network reservations

Traffic from a pod to `169.254.0.0/16` will not leave the pod network (and traffic to `169.` specifically may be further restricted). This should not affect anything in non-cloud environments, since traffic to that IP range is supposed to be link-local and so would not be expected to leave the pod network anyway.
